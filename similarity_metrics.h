/**
 * @brief Calculates the intersection and union sizes of LCP core sets from two thread arguments.
 * 
 * This function computes the intersection and union sizes between the `cores` and `counts` vectors 
 * in two thread-specific argument structures (`argument1` and `argument2`). It performs the calculations 
 * based on whether the program is operating in a set-based mode or a vector-based mode, as specified 
 * by the `program_arguments.type`.
 * 
 * @param argument1 A constant reference to the `targs` structure representing the first set of LCP cores 
 *        and counts for comparison.
 * @param argument2 A constant reference to the `targs` structure representing the second set of LCP cores 
 *        and counts for comparison.
 * @param program_arguments A constant reference to the `pargs` structure, which contains program-wide settings, 
 *        including the type of operation (set-based or vector-based).
 * @param interSize A reference to the variable where the computed size of the intersection will be stored.
 * @param unionSize A reference to the variable where the computed size of the union will be stored.
 * 
 * @details
 * - The function uses two iterators (`core1` and `core2`) to traverse the `cores` vectors of `argument1` 
 *   and `argument2` respectively, and similarly uses `count1` and `count2` for the corresponding `counts` vectors.
 * - If the LCP core in `argument1` is smaller than the core in `argument2`, the iterator for `argument1` advances, 
 *   and vice versa. When the cores match, the intersection size is updated, depending on the program type:
 *   - If `SET` mode is enabled, the intersection size is incremented by one.
 *   - If `VECTOR` mode is enabled, the intersection size is incremented by the minimum of the counts.
 * - The union size is calculated similarly, incrementing based on the maximum count when in `VECTOR` mode.
 * - After one vector is exhausted, any remaining elements in the other vector are added to the union size.
 * 
 * @note
 * - In `SET` mode, the function treats the `cores` vectors as sets and only counts unique cores for the 
 *   intersection and union.
 * - In `VECTOR` mode, the `counts` vectors are considered, and the union and intersection sizes are determined 
 *   by comparing the counts associated with each core.

/**
 * @brief Calculates a similarity score between two sets of hashed LCP cores.
 *
 * This function compares two sets of hashed LCP cores, representing genomic sequences
 * analyzed at specified depths, to compute a similarity score. The score is based on
 * the normalized Manhattan distance between the weighted counts of matching LCP cores,
 * adjusted to reflect similarity. This approach considers both the presence and abundance
 * of LCP cores in relation to the analysis depths, offering a nuanced similarity measure
 * suitable for genomic comparisons.
 *
 * @param argument1 A constant reference to the `targs` structure representing the first set of LCP cores 
 *        and counts for comparison.
 * @param argument2 A constant reference to the `targs` structure representing the second set of LCP cores 
 *        and counts for comparison.
 * @return A double representing the similarity score, ranging from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (identical).
